-  Hi, I’m @heschy2 (aka @heschy)
-  This Account has been created, because I am unable to regain access to my old account (heschy).
-  I’m currently learning Python
-  If you want to see my old projects, you should watch out my old Account, but they wont be continued if they dont get copied to this account, so if you want newer versions, you should watch out this Account.

<!---
heschy2/heschy2 is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
